# Salary Prediction App

This is a machine learning web application that predicts employee salaries based on factors like satisfaction level, years at the company, and average monthly hours worked. It is built using Python libraries such as `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `streamlit`.

## Features

- Interactive salary prediction using a Streamlit web interface  
- Data cleaning, visualization, and feature scaling  
- Multiple machine learning models: Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest  
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV  
- Evaluation using MAE and RMSE  

## Requirements

To run this project locally, the following Python libraries are required:

- pandas  
- matplotlib  
- seaborn  
- scikit-learn  
- joblib  
- streamlit  

## Run the app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
